# Bluetooth&reg; LE Battery Server with OTA update

This code example demonstrates the implementation of a simple Bluetooth&reg; Battery Service. The Battery Service exposes the battery level of the device and supports over-the-air (OTA) update over a Bluetooth&reg; Low Energy connection. A peer app on Windows can be used to push OTA updates to the device. The app downloads and writes the image to the secondary slot. On the next reboot, MCUboot copies the new image over to the primary slot and runs the application. If the new image is not validated in run time, on the next reboot, MCUboot reverts to the previously validated image.

The OTA update feature is enabled by the [anycloud-ota](https://github.com/Infineon/anycloud-ota) middleware repository on Github.

## Hardware setup

This example uses the kit’s default configuration. See the respective kit guide to ensure that the kit is configured correctly.

**Note:** The PSoC&trade; 6 Bluetooth&reg; LE pioneer kit (CY8CKIT-062-BLE) and the PSoC&trade; 6 Wi-Fi Bluetooth&reg; pioneer kit (CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT) ship with KitProg2 installed. The ModusToolbox&trade; software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/Infineon/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".


## Software setup

1. To view the battery level in Battery Service, scan the following QR code from your Android or iOS mobile device to download the AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Connect App.

   ![AppQR](./images/qr.png)


2. Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://teratermproject.github.io/index-en.html).

3. Download and install [CYPRESS&trade; Programmer](https://softwaretools.infineon.com/tools/com.ifx.tb.tool.cypressprogrammer) which will be used to program the MCUboot bootloader.

4. For OTA update functionality, download and install a peer app from the [OTA peer apps repo](https://github.com/Infineon/btsdk-peer-apps-ota). This example uses the Windows app (*WsOtaUpgrade.exe*).

**Note:** Currently, only the Windows app is supported.


## Structure and overview

This code example is a dual-core project, where the MCUboot bootloader app runs on the CM0+ core and the OTA update app runs on the CM4 core. The OTA update app fetches the new image and places it in the flash memory; the bootloader takes care of updating the existing image with the new image. [MCUboot](https://github.com/mcu-tools/mcuboot/tree/v1.8.3-cypress) v1.8.3 contains the bootloader project used as a bootloader for this code example.

If you are not familiar with MCUboot, see the [mtb-example-psoc6-mcuboot-basic](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc6-mcuboot-basic) code example.

You must first build and program the MCUboot bootloader project into the CM0+ core; this needs to be done only once. The OTA update app can then be programmed into the CM4 core; you need to only modify this app for any application purposes.


## Building and programming MCUboot

The [MCUboot](https://github.com/mcu-tools/mcuboot/tree/v1.8.3-cypress) v1.8.3 example bundles two applications:
- Bootloader app that runs on CM0+
- Blinky app that runs on CM4.

For this code example, the bootloader application will be programmed because only the bootloader app is required.

Do the following to build and program the MCUboot bootloader:

1. Clone the [MCUboot](https://github.com/mcu-tools/mcuboot/tree/v1.8.3-cypress) repo and switch to the `v1.8.3-cypress` branch.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/mcu-tools/mcuboot.git

   git checkout v1.8.3-cypress
   ```
2. The bootloader and the "mtb-example-btstack-freertos-battery-server" applications must have the same understanding of the memory layout. The information is contained inside flashmaps, which both applications must use. Check the "mtb-example-btstack-freertos-battery-server" Makefile for the `OTA_FLASH_MAP` variable to find out the flashmap being used by your application.

   You need to copy this flashmap present in *<mtb_shared>/ota-update/release-vX.X.X/configs/flashmap* to the *mcuboot\boot\cypress\* folder. To learn more about flashmaps, see [OTA_FLASH_LAYOUT_README.md](https://github.com/Infineon/ota-update/blob/master/OTA_FLASH_LAYOUT_README.md) in the [ota-update](https://github.com/Infineon/ota-update) middleware repo.

   To learn more about the defines in the Makefile (especially `OTA_PLATFORM` and `OTA_FLASH_MAP`) used by the *ota-update* library and the application, see [OTA-specific Makefile defines](https://github.com/Infineon/ota-update/blob/master/OTA_MAKEFILE_INFO_README.md#3-ota-specific-makefile-defines).

   To use a different flashmap, see the "Target and flashmap use" section in the ota-update [README.md](https://github.com/Infineon/ota-update/blob/master/README.md) and determine a compatible flashmap for your kit.

3. Open a CLI terminal.

   On Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application. On Windows, open the "modus-shell" app from the Start menu.

4. On the terminal, navigate to the */mcuboot/boot/cypress* folder.

5. Update the submodules by running the following command:

   ```
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

6. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

7. In the */mcuboot/boot/cypress* folder, execute the following command to build the application using the default toolchain and the default target (`CY8CKIT-062S2-43012`). The default toolchain and target are specified in the *toolchains.mk* file present in */mcuboot/boot/cypress*.

   ```
   make clean app APP_NAME=MCUBootApp PLATFORM=PSOC_062_2M FLASH_MAP=./psoc62_2m_int_swap_single.json`
   ```
   Make sure that `PLATFORM` and `FLASH_MAP` variables are mapped correctly while building for other kits. These variables are present in the  battery server application Makefile; use the applicable values for the target device that you are building for. For CY8CPROTO-062S3-4343W, an additional parameter (`USE_CUSTOM_DEBUG_UART`) must be provided; see this [link](https://github.com/Infineon/ota-update/blob/master/configs/flashmap/MCUBoot_Build_Commands.md#2-psoc-62-512k-internal-flash-platforms) for an example.

8. After building the MCUboot application, open the HEX file using [CYPRESS&trade; Programmer](https://softwaretools.infineon.com/tools/com.ifx.tb.tool.cypressprogrammer) located in the following root directory:

   */mcuboot/boot/cypress/MCUBootApp/out/<OTA_PLATFORM>/Debug/*

      **Figure 1. CYPRESS&trade; Programmer with HEX file image**

      ![](images/cypress_programmer.png)

9. After programming, the bootloader starts automatically. Confirm that the UART terminal displays a message as follows:

    **Figure 2. Booting with no bootable image**

    ![](images/booting_without_bootable_image.png)

**Note:** This example implements only the basic security measure via image signing and validation; it does not demonstrate securely upgrading an image and booting from it using features such as image encryption and "Secure Boot". See the [PSoC&trade; 64 line of "secure" MCUs](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/microcontroller/32-bit-psoc-arm-cortex-microcontroller/psoc-6-32-bit-arm-cortex-m4-mcu/psoc-64/) that offer all those features built around MCUboot.

## Using the code example

Make sure that the MCUboot bootloader is programmed before following the steps in this section. See the [Building and programming MCUboot](#building-and-programming-mcuboot) section for details.

## Operation

### Battery Service

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Use your favorite serial terminal application and connect to the KitProg3 COM port. Configure the terminal application to access the serial port using the following settings:

   Baud rate: 115200 bps; Data: 8 bits; Parity: None; Stop: 1 bit; Flow control: None; New line for receive data: Line Feed(LF) or Auto setting

 3. Program the board using one of the following:

    <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3)**.
    </details>

    <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

      From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:

      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:

      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```

      **Note:**  Before building the application, ensure that the *bsps* folder contains the BSP files in the *TARGET_APP_xxx* folder. If the files are missing, use the Library Manager to add these files. You can invoke the Library Manager from the terminal using the `make library-manager` command or use the Library Manager CLI tool "library-manager-cli" to add/change the BSP.

     </details>

      After programming, the application starts automatically. Observe the messages on the UART terminal, and wait for the device to make all the required connections.

#### **Test using the AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Connect mobile app**

1. Turn ON Bluetooth&reg; on your Android or iOS device.

2. Launch the AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Connect app.

3. Press the reset switch on the kit to start Bluetooth&reg; LE advertisements. The red LED (LED1) starts blinking to indicate that advertising has started. Advertising will stop after 120 seconds if a connection has not been established.

4. Swipe down on the AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Connect app home screen to start scanning for Bluetooth&reg; LE peripherals; your device appears on the AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Connect app home screen. Select your device to establish a Bluetooth&reg; LE connection (see Figure 2). Once the connection is established, the user LED turns to 'always ON' state.

   **Figure 3. AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Connect app device discovery**

   ![](images/figure2.png)

5. Select the Battery Service (see Figure 4) from the carousel view to check the battery levels. Tap **START NOTIFY** to get notifications of the changing battery levels:

   **Figure 4. AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Connect Battery Service tab**

   ![](images/figure3.png)


   **Figure 5. Battery level**

   ![](images/figure4.png)

6. A notification is issued every 1 second, and the value is reduced by 2.

7. Use the KitProg3 COM port to view the Bluetooth&reg; stack and application trace messages in the terminal window. Note the application version. This app version is as per the app version numbers defined in the Makefile `MAJOR VERSION`, `MINOR VERSION`, and `VERSION BUILD`.

   **Figure 6. Log messages on KitProg3 COM port**

   ![](images/figure5.png)


### OTA Update service

The app also supports OTA updates over Bluetooth&reg; LE. A peer app is used to push an updated image to the device. It can be downloaded from the [OTA peer apps repo](https://github.com/Infineon/btsdk-peer-apps-ota). This example uses the Windows app for pushing an OTA update image.

Once you have programmed the app by following the steps in the [Battery Service](#battery-service) section, you will see the app version as `5.0.0` in the terminal logs as shown in Figure .

For preparing the OTA update image, do the following changes to the app:

1. Change the update rate of the battery level by modifying the `BATTERY_LEVEL_CHANGE` define present in *main.c* to `4`. This shows that the battery drains at double the rate after the OTA update. This is also shown in the terminal logs as well as on the AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Connect app.

2. Update the app version number in the Makefile by changing the `MAJOR VERSION`, `MINOR VERSION`, and `VERSION BUILD`. In this example, update the version to 5.1.0 by modifying `MINOR VERSION` to `1`.

3. Build the app, but **DO NOT PROGRAM**. This version of the app will be used to push to the device via the peer Windows app (*WsOtaUpgrade.exe*).

4. In the project directory, navigate to *build/\<TARGET>/Config* and locate the *.bin* file. Copy this file to the same directory as the peer app (*WsOtaUpgrade.exe*). It is located at *btsdk-peer-apps-ota/tree/master/Windows/WsOtaUpgrade/Release/\<System Type>*.

5. Open the terminal and navigate to *WsOtaUpgrade.exe*. Initiate the update process by issuing the following command:
   ```
   ./WsOtaUpgrade.exe <App_name>.bin
   ```

6. In the dialog box that appears, select your device and click **OK** (*Battery Server* in this case). In the next window, select **Start** to begin pushing the OTA update image to the device.

   **Figure 7. WsOtaUpgrade app**

   ![](images/figure6.png)


   **Figure 8. WsOtaUpgrade app start**

   ![](images/figure7.png)

   You can monitor the progress on the Windows peer app via the progress bar or via the device terminal, which prints the percentage of download completed.

   **Figure 9. WsOtaUpgrade progress bar**

   ![](images/figure8.png)


   **Figure 10. Download progress display on the terminal**

   ![](images/figure9.png)

   Once the download is completed, the device will reboot. To manually initiate the reboot, set `reboot_at_end` to `0` in the `app_bt_initialize_default_values()` function. On reboot, MCUboot either copies the new image over to the primary slot or swaps the images in the primary and secondary slots based upon whether the overwrite- or swap-based flashmap is used, and then launches the application.

   If the new image is not validated in run time, on the next reboot, MCUboot reverts to the previously validated image. The validation is done by calling the `cy_ota_storage_validated()` API. You can turn off the validation requirement by setting `validate after reboot = 0` in the `cy_ota_agent_params_t` structure passed to the `cy_ota_agent_start` API in the *ota.c* file in the  `app_bt_ota_init` function.

   **Note:** The revert operation will happen only if swap-based flashmap is used and `validate after reboot = 1` is set in `ota_agent_parameters`. If not, the image will be validated after download by the library and marked permanent. Thus, revert will not happen because the requirement for the updated app to call `cy_ota_storage_validated()` is waived off.

   **Figure 11. MCUboot reboot on download finish**

   ![](images/figure10.png)


7. Observe the terminal for upgrade logs. Notice the updated app version in the terminal log once the app is launched by MCUboot on a successful update.

8. Once the upgrade is done, follow the steps mentioned in the [Test using the AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Connect mobile app](#test-using-the-AIROC&trade;-Bluetooth&reg;-Connect-mobile-app) section. Notice that now the rate of change of battery level is faster (reduces by 4) both in the terminal logs as well as the AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Connect app.

   **Figure 12. Updated app with faster rate of change of battery level**

   ![](images/figure11.png)


### OTA update image revert

To test the revert feature of MCUboot, you need to create and send a 'bad' image (v5.2.0) as an OTA update. The bad image used in this example does not call `cy_ota_storage_validated()`; instead it prints a banner message and issues a soft reset. Upon reboot, MCUboot reverts the primary image back to the v5.1.0 'good' image.

1. Edit the Makefile and add `TEST_REVERT` to the `Defines` variable to test the revert functionality:

   ```
   DEFINES+=CY_RETARGET_IO_CONVERT_LF_TO_CRLF CY_RTOS_AWARE TEST_REVERT
   ```

2. Edit the app version in the Makefile by setting `APP_VERSION_MINOR` to `2`. Once the changes are done, build the app, but **DO NOT PROGRAM**.

3. Use *WsOtaUpgrade.exe* to push the OTA update image to the device as done in steps **3, 4, and 5** of the [OTA Update Service](#ota-update-service) section.

4. After a reset, MCUboot will now find this new v4.2.0 image and update to it. After the update, a banner text is printed on the terminal and a soft reset is issued. Upon reset, MCUboot starts reverting to the v4.1.0 'good' image.

   **Figure 13. MCUboot reverting the image**

   ![](images/figure12.png)


## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice - once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.infineon.com/t5/Knowledge-Base-Articles/PSoC-6-MCU-Code-in-main-executes-before-the-debugger-halts-at-the-first-line-of/ta-p/253856) to learn about this and for the workaround.


## Design and implementation

The code example has two main services:

1. A Bluetooth&reg; LE GATT Server for Battery Service

   Battery Service is used to simulate the battery level, which changes continuously from 100 to 0 percent in steps defined by the `BATTERY_LEVEL_CHANGE` macro. It has a default value of 2 percent. On a periodic timer, notifications are sent to the client.

2. OTA Firmware Upgrade Service

   The OTA Firmware Upgrade Service enables updating the application image remotely. A peer app on Windows/Android/iOS (currently, only Windows peer app is supported) can be used to push an OTA update to the device.

   The app downloads and writes the image to the secondary slot. On the next reboot, MCUboot copies the new image over to the primary slot and runs the application. If the new image is not validated in run time, on the next reboot, MCUboot reverts to the previously validated image.

   **Figure 14. OTA image transfer sequence**

   ![](images/figure13.png)

   **Note:** Thin lines in this diagram correspond to the messages sent using the Control Point characteristic. Thick lines indicate messages sent using the Data characteristic.

Before performing the upgrade procedure, the peer app on the host should enable notifications and indications for the Control Point characteristic by writing the corresponding value to the Client Characteristic Configuration descriptor. If the peer app on the host uses a Bluetooth&reg; stack that does not allow the configuration of simultaneous notifications and indications, at least one of them must be configured.

All multi-octet values (for example, the size of the image and CRC32 checksum) are sent in little-endian format.

1. To start the upgrade, the peer app on the host sends the `CY_OTA_UPGRADE_COMMAND_PREPARE_DOWNLOAD` command (see tables 1 and 2 for details of the commands and events).

   This indicates that a new upgrade process is being started. The data received after that command is stored from the zero-offset position of the inactive logical memory partition. The OTA update library initializes the storage and clears the secondary storage on receiving this command.

2. After the peer app on the host receives the `CY_OTA_UPGRADE_STATUS_OK` message, it should send the `CY_OTA_UPGRADE_COMMAND_DOWNLOAD` command, passing four bytes specifying the memory image size to be downloaded.

3. If `CY_OTA_UPGRADE_STATUS_OK` is received in the reply, the peer app on the host starts sending chunks of data.

4. After the final image chunk is sent, the peer app on the host sends the `CY_OTA_UPGRADE_COMMAND_VERIFY` command passing the image checksum calculated on the host. The library verifies the stored image and sends the `CY_OTA_UPGRADE_STATUS_OK` or `CY_OTA_UPGRADE_STATUS_VERIFICATION_FAILED` message to the peer app on the host.

   - If verification is successful, the library marks the secondary storage as verified.
   - If the verification is not successful, the firmware sends a `CY_OTA_UPGRADE_STATUS_VERIFICATION_FAILED` status to the peer app on the host.

      Depending on whether `reboot_at_end` was set as `0` (do not automatically reboot after download) or `1` (reboot after download), the device will be rebooted. On the next reboot, MCUboot will pick up the image and perform the update.

   - If the download process is interrupted or if the verification fails, the embedded application continues its execution. To restart the process, the peer app on the host will need to start from the beginning by sending `CY_OTA_UPGRADE_COMMAND_PREPARE_DOWNLOAD`.

The following GATT procedures are used in the communication:

- All commands and data packets are sent from the peer app on the host to the embedded application using the GATT Write Request procedure.

- All the messages to the peer app on the host except for the final verification message (`CY_OTA_UPGRADE_STATUS_OK`) are sent using the GATT Notification procedure.

- The verification `OK` message is sent using the GATT Indication procedure.

- If the peer app on the host enabled notifications and did not allow indications, the verification message (`CY_OTA_UPGRADE_STATUS_OK`) is sent using the GATT Notify procedure.

For a better performance, it is recommended that the peer app on the host negotiates the largest possible MTU and sends data chunks of (MTU minus 3) octets.

###	Secure OTA image update

This code example uses the private key to sign the OTA update image that is downloaded to the device during the OTA update. The image gets validated by the bootloader via the public key programmed along with the MCUboot bootloader (bootloader project). That way, only an image from a trusted source can be installed onto the device using OTA.

The keys used are test keys that are located in the *ota_source/keys* directory. The *cypress-test-ec-p256.pem* file is the private key and the *cypress-test-ec-p356.pub* file is the public key. These file names are specified in the Makefile for the Battery Server application.


#### **Generate a public/private key pair**

The key pair from the MCUboot library is used for signing in this code example; however, you must not use it for a production design because the private key is widely available.

You can generate your own key pair using the Python *imgtool* program or another key generation utility.

The imgtool utility is available in the MCUboot library:
*\<workspace>/mtb_shared/mcuboot/\<version>/scripts*. Once you are in that directory, in a command terminal (*modus-shell* for Windows), use the following to generate the private key and then extract the public key in the form of a C array.

```
python imgtool.py keygen -k my_key.pem -t ecdsa-p256

python imgtool.py getpub -k my_key.pem >> my_key.pub
```

**Note:** The names of the private and public keys should be the same except for the extension (*pem* for the private key and *pub* for the public key).


#### **Root of Trust for secured boot and secure key storage**

This code example demonstrates the image signing and validation features of MCUboot. Root of trust (RoT)-based secured services such as secured boot and secured storage and OTA update image encryption are not implemented in this example. To learn about these, check out the [PSoC&trade; 64 line of "secure" MCUs](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/microcontroller/32-bit-psoc-arm-cortex-microcontroller/psoc-6-32-bit-arm-cortex-m4-mcu/psoc-64/) that offer all those features built around MCUboot.

## Resources and settings

This section explains the ModusToolbox&trade; software resources and their configuration as used in this code example. Note that all the configuration explained in this section has already been done in the code example. ModusToolbox&trade; software stores the configuration settings of the application in the *design.modus* file. This file is used by the graphical configurators, which generate the configuration firmware. This firmware is stored in the application’s *GeneratedSource* folder.

- **Device Configurator:** Use this tool to enable/configure the peripherals and the pins used in the application. See the [Device Configurator guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxDeviceConfig).

- **Bluetooth&reg; Configurator:** Use this tool to generate/modify the Bluetooth&reg; LE GATT database. See the [Bluetooth&reg; Configurator guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxBLEConfig).
